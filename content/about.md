**Crypto Startup Founder â€¢ Tech Enthusiast â€¢ Global Citizen**  


## ðŸ‘‹ Say Hello

Hey! I'm the founder of [DIN](https://din.lol/), a geek obsessed with blockchain technology and the digital future. Before diving into the crypto rabbit hole, I navigated the SAP enterprise world, building digital solutions across three continents.

From [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) to [UniversitÃ¤t Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/) â€” my educational journey has been as borderless as my career.

## ðŸ’¡ My Perspective

Technology isn't just code and algorithms; it's a bridge connecting people with possibilities. I believe Web3 and blockchain are reshaping how we interact, create, and share value.
